# Detailed-Tomato-leaf-disease-Detection-using-Transfer-Learning
I Successfully developed an advanced disease detection model for tomato leaves, employing deep learning and transfer learning techniques. Classified 10 diseases with high precision using a MobileNetV2 model trained on a dataset of 30,000 tomato leaf images containing different backgrounds. Achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 97%. 
Implemented a user-friendly web application using Flask, allowing users to upload leaf images for real-time disease detection. The application provides detailed information about detected diseases and suggests corresponding remedies.

This is a demo of my capstone Project :
